# Security and Authentication

## Authentication with Clerk

The Scholarship Management System uses **Clerk** for authentication and user management, providing a secure, scalable, and feature-rich authentication solution.

## Clerk Integration

### Why Clerk?
- **Enterprise-grade security**: SOC 2 Type II certified
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Built-in 2FA support
- **Social login**: Google, Microsoft, GitHub integration
- **Session management**: Automatic token refresh
- **User management UI**: Pre-built components
- **Webhooks**: Real-time user events
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in protection

### Clerk Features Used
- User registration and sign-in
- Email verification
- Password reset functionality
- Session management
- User metadata storage
- Role-based access control
- OAuth social providers

## User Roles

### Role Management
The system implements two primary user roles:
- **Student**: Can browse and apply for scholarships
- **Administrator**: Can manage scholarships, review applications, and generate reports

Roles are stored in Clerk's user metadata and synchronized with the database for efficient access control.

### Role Assignment
- New users default to Student role
- Administrators are assigned manually through Clerk dashboard
- Role changes trigger database synchronization
- Audit trail tracks all role modifications

## Security Best Practices

### Data Protection

#### Encryption Standards
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- **File Storage**: Encrypted Supabase storage buckets
- **Password Hashing**: Handled by Clerk with industry standards

#### Personal Data Handling
- Minimal data collection principle
- Encrypted storage of sensitive information
- Secure deletion procedures
- Data anonymization for analytics

### Input Validation
- Schema validation using Zod
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma
- XSS protection in React components
- File type and size validation
- Sanitization of user inputs

### File Upload Security
- Allowed file types restriction
- Maximum file size limits (10MB default)
- Virus scanning integration ready
- Secure file naming conventions
- Isolated storage buckets

### API Security

#### Rate Limiting
- Standard endpoints: 100 requests per minute
- Authentication endpoints: 5 requests per minute
- File uploads: 10 requests per minute
- Report generation: 5 requests per hour

#### CORS Configuration
- Whitelisted domains only
- Credentials support for authenticated requests
- Appropriate HTTP methods allowed
- Custom headers configuration

### Session Management
- JWT token-based authentication
- Automatic token refresh
- Session timeout configuration
- Concurrent session limits
- Device tracking and management

## Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging
All critical operations are logged including:
- User authentication events
- Role changes
- Data modifications
- File uploads/downloads
- Administrative actions
- Failed access attempts

### Security Alerts
Automated alerts for:
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Large data exports
- System configuration changes

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- User consent for data processing
- Right to access personal data
- Right to rectification
- Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
- Data portability
- Privacy by design principles

### Data Retention Policy
- Application data: 2 years after decision
- User profiles: Until account deletion requested
- Documents: 1 year after application cycle
- Audit logs: 5 years for compliance
- Backups: 90 days rolling window

### Privacy Protection
