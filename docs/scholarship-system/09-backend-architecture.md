# Backend Architecture with Supabase and Prisma

## Overview

The Scholarship Management System backend leverages **Supabase** as the Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform and **Prisma** as the ORM for type-safe database access. The frontend is built with **Vite** and **React**, using **TanStack Router** for routing.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Vite**: Modern build tool for fast development
- **React 19**: UI library for building user interfaces
- **TanStack Router**: Type-safe routing solution
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database, real-time subscriptions, storage, and edge functions
- **Prisma**: Type-safe ORM with migrations and schema management
- **Clerk**: Authentication and user management

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a feature-based architecture:
- **Features folder**: Contains all feature modules (dashboard, scholarships, applications, etc.)
- **Components folder**: Reusable UI components built with Shadcn/ui
- **Context folder**: React context providers for global state
- **Hooks folder**: Custom React hooks for business logic
- **Lib folder**: Utility functions and service configurations
- **Routes folder**: TanStack Router route definitions

### Backend Services

#### Supabase Configuration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Storage**: Secure file storage for documents
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for background processing
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live updates

#### Prisma Integration
- Schema-first development approach
- Type-safe database queries
- Automated migrations
- Database seeding for development

## Data Models

### Core Entities

#### User Model
- Synchronized with Clerk authentication
- Stores user ID, email, and role
- Links to profile information
- Tracks created and updated timestamps

#### Profile Model
- Extended user information
- Personal details (name, date of birth, gender)
- Academic information (program, level, GPA)
- Contact information

#### Scholarship Model
- Scholarship details and requirements
- Sponsor information
- Financial details (amount, slots)
- Application period dates
- Eligibility criteria

#### Application Model
- Links students to scholarships
- Application status tracking
- Submission timestamps
- Review information
- Decision tracking

#### Document Model
- File metadata storage
- Document types (transcript, recommendation, etc.)
- Verification status
- File path references to Supabase Storage

#### Sponsor Model
- Organization information
- Contact details
- Funding commitments
- Active scholarships

## API Design

### RESTful Endpoints
The system exposes RESTful API endpoints for:
- User profile management
- Scholarship browsing and filtering
- Application submission and tracking
- Document upload and management
- Administrative operations
- Reporting and analytics

### Authentication Flow
1. User authenticates via Clerk
2. Clerk JWT token validates requests
3. User role determines access permissions
4. Database operations use user context

### Real-time Features
- Application status updates
- New scholarship notifications
- Document verification status
- Dashboard statistics refresh

## Database Schema Design Principles

### Normalization
- Properly normalized tables to prevent data redundancy
- Junction tables for many-to-many relationships
- Foreign key constraints for referential integrity

### Indexing Strategy
- Primary key indexes on all tables
- Foreign key indexes for join performance
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Full-text search indexes for scholarship search

### Data Types
- UUID for primary keys
- Enums for predefined values (status, role, etc.)
- JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- Timestamps for audit trails

## File Storage Architecture

### Document Management
- Secure file upload to Supabase Storage
- File type validation and size restrictions
- Organized folder structure by user and document type
- Public URL generation for authorized access

### Storage Buckets
- **documents**: Student-uploaded files
- **profiles**: Profile pictures
- **sponsors**: Sponsor logos
- **exports**: Generated reports

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- Clerk handles user authentication
- Role-based access control (Student, Admin)
- JWT tokens for API authentication
- Session management

### Data Protection
- Row Level Security in PostgreSQL
- Encrypted file storage
- HTTPS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization

### Audit Trail
- All critical operations logged
- User actions tracked with timestamps
- IP address and user agent recording
- Immutable audit log entries

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Efficient query design with Prisma
- Proper indexing for fast lookups
- Query result caching
- Connection pooling

### Caching Strategy
- TanStack Query for client-side caching
- Supabase edge caching
- Static asset caching
- API response caching

### Real-time Optimization
- Selective subscriptions
- Debounced updates
- Efficient payload sizes
- Connection management

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run database migrations
5. Seed development data
6. Start Vite dev server

### Database Management
- Prisma CLI for migrations
- Schema versioning
- Rollback capabilities
- Seed scripts for test data

### Testing Environment
- Separate Supabase project for testing
- Test database with sample data
- Mock authentication for testing
- Isolated file storage
